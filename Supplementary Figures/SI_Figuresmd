Figure S1 – Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identity by state. SNP identity by state heatmap showing the level of SNP identity between samples (0-1.0 indicates 0-100% identity), based on the Broad Institute’s GATK.

 
Figure S2. Interaction heatmap of host genes. The heatmap on the left shows the relative expression values of a subset of S. pistillata genes that demonstrate a significant interaction between base-tip (position factor) versus up-down (ring height factor).  The heatmap on the right represents the log2FC of the interactions. For clarity, only interactions for tips and bases are shown.
 

 
Figure S3. Gene expression patterns of putative toxins as log2FC (a, c), and log10FPKM  (b, d) between branch tips and junctions (a, b) and junctions and bases (c, d). Only significantly DE toxin genes are shown (p<0.05). An uncharacterized gene, for which reciprocal BLAST hits suggest it is a SCRiP (SI Table 14), is noted with a red star (b).

Figure S4. Reciprocal protein blast information (a) and sequence alignment (b) for the D-Pocilopotoxin-Spi1 in [5] (Stylophora_pistillata_9725 from Bhattacharya, 2016]) and the gene27671 (rna35563) annotated here as DELTA-stichotoxin-She4a-like (NCBI accession number XP_022777760.1).



 
Figure S5. Gene expression patterns of known biomineralization-related genes as log2FC (a, c), and log10FPKM (b, d) between branch tips and junctions (a, b) and junctions and bases (c, d). Only significantly DE biomineralization genes are shown (p<0.05).
 
 
Figure S6. Percent fluorescence, relative to the injected fluoresceine dye aliquot’s fluorescence, of various volumes of water extracted by syringe either on the opposite side of the branch from the dye injection (a) or at colony peripheries (b). Fluorescence higher than the background water was not observed for extraction volumes of 1.6 ml or smaller.
